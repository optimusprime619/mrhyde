I am a computer science graduate and been a web developer from 2010. I started my career as a PHP/Drupal developer and worked on projects in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) versions 6, 7 and more recently 8. The ease of use of PHP as a programming language and drupal as a framework along with the wonderful resources and help of the opensource community has kept me passionate. **Translation:** With no fondness for mathematics or java syntax at earlier stages of my life, I chose the easy way and found it much to my liking.

When I'm not firefighting a production server outage (which in my defence happens to be no fault of mine), debugging 'complex' PHP logic with a series of echo and exit or partaking in watercooler talk, I am an amateur pencil artist and avid fan of manga and animation genres. That's fancy talk to imply I draw mediocre pencil sketches once a year or so.

I'm currently on a journey of wading through new waters of different technology stack and intend to share my learnings and perspectives through here.

You will find me as optimusprime on [Drupal Answers](https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/2699/optimusprime619) and [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/optimusprime619)
